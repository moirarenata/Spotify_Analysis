# Spotify Wrapped (Moira's Version) 

We can all agree that the 2024 Spotify Wrapped was a bit of a letdown. Everyone was waiting to hear about their music aura location based on their listening activity for the past year. 
Instead, we got AI-generated music evolutions like Pink Pilates Princess and Vampire Rock April—seriously, what does that even mean? 
So, I took matters into my own hands and explored my Spotify listening activity using Spotify’s API to uncover some interesting stats! 
This repository contains the code and data needed to perform and reproduce the analysis. (Client ID and Client Secret have been removed.)

**Repository structure:**
  - `data/`: Contains JSON files with my Spotify listening activity data retrieved from Spotify.
  - `data_viz/`: Holds the cleaned dataframe used for creating visualizations on another platform.
  - `spotify_analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data processing and analysis.
  - `README.md` (this file): Provides an overview of the project and its structure.
