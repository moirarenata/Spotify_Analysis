0,Stick Season,"[Verse 1]
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

[Chorus]
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

[Verse 2]
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

1,You’re Gonna Go Far,"[Verse 1]
The only time I got to praying for a red light
Was when I saw your destination as a deadline
""This is normal conversation, babe, it's all fine""
Making quiet calculations where the fault lies
This is good land, or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind

[Verse 2]
The college kids are getting so young, ain't they?
They're correcting all the grammar on our spray paint
And I even gave up driving after nightfall
I got tired of the frat boys with their brights on
This is good land, or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind

[Pre-Chorus]
It makes me smile to know when things get hard
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far
Ooh-ooh, you'll bе far from here
And, while I clеan shit up in the yard
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far, far from here

[Chorus]
So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds will still sing
Your folks will still fight
The boards will still creak
The leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love

We sure will

[Verse 3]
We're overdue for a revival
We spent so long just getting by
That's the thing about survival
Who the hell, who the hell likes livin' just to die?
You told me you would make a difference
Well, I got drunk and shut you down
It won't be by your own volition
If you step foot outside this town
But it's all we've had
For always

[Chorus]
So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds will still sing
Your folks will still fight
The boards will still creak
The leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love

3,Orange Juice,"[Verse 1]
Honey, come over
The party's gone slower
And no one will tempt you
We know you got sober
There's orange juice in the kitchen
Bought for the children
It's yours if you want it
We're just glad you could visit

[Chorus]
Feels like I've been ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn't think to ask you where you'd gone
Why'd you go?

[Post-Chorus]
And you said
""Mm-hmm, mm-hmm-mm""
And you said
You said my heart has changed and my soul has changed
And my heart, and my heart
Now my face has changed, and I haven't drank
In six months on the dot

[Verse 2]
See the graves as you pass through
From our crash back in '02
Not one nick on your finger
You just asked mе to hold you
But it made you a stranger
And filled you with angеr
Now I'm third in the line up
To your Lord and your Savior

And you know I'd say, the last time I drank
I was face down, passed out there in your lawn

4,Dial Drunk,"[Verse 1]
I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out
So I ain't takin' any fault

It's all the same anyways

In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone

I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang

I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

[Verse 2]
I'm untetherin' from the parts of me you'd recognize
From charmin' to alarmin' in seconds

5,Forever,"[Verse 1]
Let's drive for no reason, let's see where these wheels land
Let's grind down the curve of this earth
You look fine in the evening and, honey, it's starting to storm
When we kissed in the car in the school parking lot
Where I'd go with my friends to get drunk
Used to wish I meant anything to anywhere, to anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
When forever was a sentence, sentence to death
Oh, when you wеre a running tear, I was a drop of sweat
And thе edges of your soul, I haven't seen yet
Now I'm glad I get forever to see where you end

[Chorus]
I won't be alone for the rest of my life
I'll build a boat for when the river gets high
And I'll meet a girl in the heat of July
And I'll tell her so she knows
That I'm broke, but I'm real rich in my head
That I broke a bone that never healed in my hand
So, when I hold her close
I might loosen my grip, but I won't ever let her go
I won't ever let her go
Woo

If you're into masochistic bullshit
And every photograph

Eight years ago, a distance runner
And that makes a lot of sense

For anyone tryna move
The fuck away from hibernation

Okay

[Verse 1]
How have things been? Well, love, now that you mention it
My folks still talk, but they speak in these two-word sentences
I'm sayin' too much, but you know how it gets out here
No winter coat could keep out all the cold of your atmosphere

[Chorus]
We once sang
""Retrograde"", we'd shake the frame of your car

Write mе a list of how it is, of how it was, of how it has to be
You burrowed in under my skin, what I'd give to have you out from me
But I still recall how the leather in your car feels

9,No Complaints,"[Verse 1]
I thought I had something
And that's the same as having something
I get mad at nothing, blame my dad for something
I pull no punches, then feel bad for months
Mm, thought I was raised better, tried to fake better
Tried to blame weather and escape better
Hope the skin heals where the pain enters

Oh, but I finally got sewed up
I set a time, then I showed up
And, now, the weight of the world ain't so bad
Mm-mhm

[Chorus]
I saw the еnd, it looks just like the middle
I got a papеr and pen and a page with no space
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication
And forgot how to cry
Who am I to complain?

[Verse 2]
And now the pain's different
It still exists, it just escapes different
And evades vision, makes the rain different
Makes the news boring, and my rage distant
Yes, I'm young and living dreams
In love with being noticed
And afraid of being seen
But I can finally eat
And I can fall asleep
It's fine, fine, fine

And evades vision, makes the rain different. Makes the news boring, and my rage distant. Yes, I'm young and living dreams. In love with being noticed. And afraid of being seen. But I can finally eat.

10,False Confidence,"[Verse 1]
Don't take yourself so seriously
Look at you all dressed up for someone you never see
You're here for a reason but you don't know why
You're split and uneven, your hands to the sky
Surrender yourself

[Chorus]
And I wonder why I tear myself down to be built back up again
Oh, I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again
All that's left of myself, holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down and hope I wake up young again

[Post-Chorus]
Hope I wake up young again

Don't let those demons in again
I fill the void up with polished doubt, fake sentiment
Surrender yourself

Oh, I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again

13,The View Between Villages,"[Verse 1]
Air in my lungs 'til the road begins
As the last of the bugs leave their homes again
And I'm splittin' the road down the middle
For a minute, the world seemed so simple

[Verse 2]
Feel the rush of my blood, I'm seventeen again
I am not scared of death, I've got dreams again
It's just me and the curve of the valley
And there is meanin' on earth, I am happy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Past Alger Brook Road, I'm over the bridge
A minute from home, but I feel so far from it
The death of my dog, the stretch of my skin
It's all washin' over me, I'm angry again
The things that I lost here, the people I knew
They got me surrounded for a mile or two
The car's in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel
I'm back between villages, and everything's still

Taking it slowly
I'm afraid to be lonely
Nobody told me
It's harder than I thought to tell the truth
It's gonna leave you in pieces
All alone with your demons
And I know that we need this
But I've been too afraid to follow through

Hold me close and I won't leave
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
So much to say but I don't speak
And I hate that I let you stop me
'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

Don't know where the time went
Stuck in the wrong mindset
I let the rules bend
When I know that all along they're made to break
You got me searching for reasons
To keep me from leaving

I give myself another chance to stay

County line, I'm countin' down
Mailboxes until my house

Vail bought the mountains, and nothing was the same

But it just ain't that simple, it never was
We'll drink 'til New Year's, then they'll leave me to clean up

[Chorus]
One day, I'm gonna cut it clear
Ride like Paul Revere
And, when they ask me who I am
I'll say, ""I'm not from around here""

I'll leave before the road crew's out
Before those joggers, looking way too proud
And I'll turn up the music and I'll forget
Until it ends, that I'm not ready to let go yet

16,New Perspective,"[Verse 1]
Ooh, silence is making me nostalgic
Two sizes big your shirt in my apartment
Oh, we were kids, but that don't make this less hard
If I could fly I doubt I'd even do it
I'd probably get high and crash or something stupid
You made Ohio feel just like Central Park

[Pre-Chorus]
Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
And mine's full of receipts

Ooh, this town's for the record now
The intersection got a Target
And they're calling it downtown
You and all of your new perspective now
Wish I could shut it in a closet
And drag you back down

[Verse 2]
Gave me your word and now I can't pronounce it
No thing so sure that I can't learn to doubt it
Now the state bird, it sings our song so out of key

17,Growing Sideways,"[Verse 1]
So I took my medication and I poured my trauma out
On some sad-eyed, middle-aged man's overpriced new leather couch
And we argued about Jesus, finally found some middle ground
I said, ""I'm cured""

[Verse 2]
And I divvied up my anger into thirty separate parts
Keep the bad shit in my liver and the rest around my heart
I'm still angry at my parents for what their parents did to them
But it's a start

[Pre-Chorus]
But I ignore things and I move sideways
'Til I forget what I felt in the first place
At the end of the day, I know there are worse ways to stay alive

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone's growing and everyone's healthy
I'm terrified that I might never have met me
Oh, if my engine works perfect on empty
I guess I'll drive
I guess I'll drive

[Verse 3]
So I forgot my medication, fell into a manic high
Spent my savings at a Lulu, now I'm sufferin' in style
Why is pain so damn impatient? Ain't like it's got a place to be
Keeps rushin' me

Look at me and don't you lie
I could be your sacrifice
But don't you hold your head up high
For bullshit, I do not have time
I could be an old tattoo
To remind me when I get bad news
That I do not exist to die
But live to die while saving you

19,Strawberry Wine,"[Verse 1]
Darling, speak to me but don't you say a word
Light a cigarette, I'll watch it as it burns
Remember telling me that you thought you were cursed?
I'm in love with every song you've ever heard

[Verse 2]
If I could lose you, I would
We buried your bones in plywood
If I could lose you, I would
We buried your bones in plywood

[Pre-Chorus]
I said love is fast asleep
On a dirt road with your head on my shoulder

[Chorus]
Strawberry wine, and all the time we used to have
Those things I miss but know are never coming back
For you, darling, for you
No thing definеs a man like love that makes him soft
And sеntimental like a stranger in the park
For a few moments, I see you
[Bridge]
If I was empty space and you were a formless shape, we'd fit
But love leaves little runway and every time we run straight over it

20,Pain Is Cold Water,"[Verse 1]
I'm the tall glass of water you lost in your kitchen
I'm casually cruel like a senior prediction
Most likely to leave at the sign of a fork in the road
You looked just like your father as the news was delivered
Cut a hole in my heart that bled into my liver
I miss being alone when it didn't mean being alone

[Verse 2]
And if love was contagious, I might be immune to it
Pain's like cold water, your brain just gets used to it
I try to keep swimming and keep Dad's good word in my [heart/mouth]
[But/Wеll,] they're fighting like dogs in thе town across the river
Over a brand-new crosswalk that won't matter come winter
[Oh/Lord,/And] sometimes folks just need something to be angry about
What you angry about?

[Chorus]
I ain't bitter 'bout much these days
In some ways, I'm damn lucky to be here
Where the miners stayed in the good old days
Yes, real men used to sleep here
[By/And,] those roadside graves [where/that] my friends still lay in
I walk by just to weep here
They say killing time ain't a homicide
But a prayer for a leap year

I'm the roach in your drawer, I lived here long before you
I'm the rumble of war, it gets hard to ignore you

Scream at
I'm the hills in the distance, you see me, can't be me
You need me in half, Lord, I need you completely

21,Young Blood,"[Verse 1]
Oh dear, oh dear, I’m sorry
That you grew up so soon
A cold year and no high school parties
I’ve been drinking alone
Oh, I’ve been drinking alone
So, don't fear, don’t fear their warnings
They’re bitterer than most
4 years of driving across the country
For empty seats at their shows
And they’ve been drinking alone

[Chorus]
So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You young, young blood
Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You young, young blood
You young, young blood
Young blood

[Verse 2]
So when you’re mad for no reason
At everything at once
And when you start overthinking
I’ll be drinking at home
Oh, I’ll be drinking at home

Tell me, lover
Now that you made your change

And did you lose that longing now?
For a walk through an ocean town
'Cause this town's just an ocean now

You don't hate the summers
You're just afraid of the space
Asking strangers for answers
To forget what they say
A boat beside a dock in the sunlight
Nothing but the water and the sunrise now
Just the lack of an open mouth
'Cause this town's just an ocean now

24,The Great Divide,"[Verse 1]
I can't recall the last time that we talked
About anything but looking out for cops
We got cigarette burns on the same side of our hands, but we ain't friends
We're just morons who broke skin in the same spot
But I've never seen you take a turn that wide
And I'm high enough to still care if I die
Well, I tried to read the thoughts that you'd worked overtime to stop
You said, ""Fuck off,"" and I said nothing for a while

[Chorus]
You know I think about you all the time
And my deep misundеrstanding of your life
And how bad it must have been for you back then
And how hard it was to keep it all insidе
I hope you settle down, I hope you marry rich
I hope you're scared of only ordinary shit
Like murderers and ghosts and cancer on your skin
And not your soul and what He might do with it

[Verse 2]
You inched yourself across the great divide
While we drove aimlessly along the Twin State line
I heard nothing but the bass in every ballad that you'd play
While you swore to God the singer read your mind
But the world is scared of hesitating things
Yeah, they only shoot the birds who cannot sing
And I'm finally aware of how shitty and unfair
It was to stare ahead like everything was fine

25,Carlo’s Song,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember drinking in the parking lot
By the trailhead?
I see you for a moment, then the morning comes
And it's wasted
We listen to ""Only The Good Die Young""
And we laughed about its statement
We walked in the same direction, but we both got lost
In your angst and my impatience

[Chorus]
Did you find what you were looking for?
Some escape from your skin
You know that place you were dreaming of
Where all light comes in
I hope you know I grew my hair out long
And your sister's just fine
I keep burning my bridges down
Just to keep you alive

26,Mess,"[Verse 1]
If I could give this all back
I would be home in the morning
I'd wake up in a cold sweat
Take a flight back to the city I was born in
And I would wipe myself clean
Of what I knew was unimportant
I'd want typical things
I'd try to fit back into all my old clothing

[Pre-Chorus]
And I would prove myself wrong
That all along, the problem was me
With all my bitterness gone
Happy, I'd be

[Chorus]
I'll move back home forever, I'll feed the dogs
And I'll put all my pieces back together
Where they belong, and I'll say
""I'm a mess, I'm a mess, oh God, I'm a mess""
And I'll take 89 to Boston, see my love
And I'll help her set up her new apartment
And we'll get drunk, and she'll say
""Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God""

I forgot the way I looked before I wore it

And we'll get drunk, and she'll say
""Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God""

[Verse 2]
So I paid off my debts, but I found the world boring
So I called my old friends, but they only ever ask me how tour is
And there's still weight on my back, I just try to ignore it
I guess the stage was my mask
I forgot the way I looked before I wore it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I would prove myself wrong
That all along, the problem was me
With all my bitterness gone
Happy, I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll move back home forever, I'll feed the dogs
And I'll put all my pieces back together
Where they belong, and I'll say
""I'm a mess, I'm a mess, oh God, I'm a mess""
And I'll take 89 to Boston, see my love
And I'll help her set up her new apartment
And we'll get drunk, and she'll say
""Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess""

[Bridge]
That's not what I had hoped
Now I find comfort in the cold

[Chorus]

28,Halloween,"[Verse 1]
I'm sailin' away to a place I'm afraid of
The dawn isn't here, the sun hasn't rose
I'm drinkin' my days with the coastal longshoreman
They got money to make and children back home
The last that I heard, you were down in New Orleans
Workin' your days at The Print
I drink 'til I drown and I smoke 'til I'm burnin'
Your hands are all over my scent
I worry for you, you worry for me
And it's fine if we know we won't change
Collect every dream in these old empty pockets
In hope that I'll need them some day

[Chorus]
But the wreckage of you, I no longer reside in
And the bridges have long since been burnt
The ash of the home that I started the fire in
It starts to return to the Earth
I'm leavin' this town and I'm changin' my address
I know that you'll come if you want
It's not Halloween, but the ghost you dressed up as
Sure knows how to haunt, yes, it knows how to haunt

I'm seein' my life on a screen
I'm hearin' your voice in a strange foreign language

29,Sink,"[Verse 1]
Oh, she hates to say goodbye
So she only says goodnight
When she goes, she stops to look behind
And I'll sink
Oh, she sleeps with one eye closed
So she can tell when she's alone
Oh no, yeah, summer comes and goes
But I'll sink

Oh, she's the sunset in the west
Oh, she is sleep when I need rest
And though the ship can be saved yet
And oh, for you, I would never sink again
And oh, for you, I would never sink again

Oh, she promises to write
I know it's harder if she tries

30,Anyway,"[Verse 1]
Dirt on your heels, you've made a mess
Down by the carpark, high off your head
Honey don't worry, nobody's angry at any of this
Darling be patient, stare into the vacancy, take a deep breath

[Verse 2]
It's like when you're tired, you're someone else
Don't speak for some time to find those words inside yourself
Honey, don't worry, I'll do your laundry, covered in dirt
Darling be patient, it's easy to break beneath the weight of the earth
And I said

Always, I'll wait
For sharp glass when you break
I'll be the light that you can't make
I'll be your eyes, you be my face
'Cause darling, I get scared for you
And I'm not busy anyway

Today you looked older than me
Hair in your face, it fills the space between your teeth
And all of your falling, has it got exhausting? Have you gotten sleep?
You said you were sorry, that you hadn't called me in over a week

31,Glue Myself Shut,"[Verse 1]
You used to be scared of the water
You're safe by the side of your father
Your sense of the world lay
In your little home by the harbor
You've always felt small in the city
To think that last fall you were with me
And all of your old clothes
Are still in the hall of my building

[Chorus]
You never asked once
No, you never asked why
If I was putting things off
If I was drinking too much of that red wine
Oh, you'd wear yourself thin
And accept every sin
And if I glued myself shut
You would find your way in

[Verse 2]
We gambled our souls to the summer
And rattled our bones to the thunder
We watched every sunset
Until we got sick of each other
You've always said fall was your season
That everyone's here for a reason
I stare at your packed bags
And ask what the hell you were meaning

It only feels real after raining
And hearts only heal after breaking
I stare at the tree line
And noticed the leaves aren't changing
And does the wind blow in Cape Elizabeth?
Constant and cold, how do you live with this?
Love was a deadline
Spend the rest of my life fuckin' missing it

32,Please,"I stare at the headlights till I get my head right
And the dogs stop their howls on the porch
My head is an ocean and I'm getting homesick
For a place I've never known
And I just keep laughing when I'm stuck in traffic
At the metaphor I've become
Maybe I'm restless, a manic depressive
Or maybe I need someone, or maybe not

So please just give me something for the pain
'Cause my heart softens to your name
And when you're gone I come undone
And when you're gone how come I'm weak
And I walk wires and I pull teeth
And I'm so tired of chasing dreams
I need someone to wake me up

I remember the evening you showed me Cat Stevens
Now I fill the room up with ""Father and Son""

33,Still,"[Intro]
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
It only falls into place when you're falling to pieces
You find love that lasts a while 'til you lose the reasons
Sayin' God, I'm alive
But the whole place is quiet
You miss something that you can't place but you can't deny it
Don't know whether you want a place in the coast or the country
You can't stay here, it's hard to face and it feels too ugly
You light a fire inside yourself, let it burn
Stare up at a starless sky and you say

[Chorus]
It's like I'm still here with you
It's like I'm still here with you
I don't, I don't, I don't want to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
The past coming back with the light in the morning
Look down on myself like a patient in surgery
And I used to watch my mother move
Like God was in the room
It's a bottomless hole I've found out here with a trace of no one
Grab a past box of photos, I rip myself open
I'm in bed and I'm wondering
If I'm callous but hoping
Can I fix what is broken?

34,Godlight,"[Verse 1]
There's no way out of an angry crowd without steppin' on some toes
They'll scream your name 'til the lights go out then they'll feed you to the wolves
It's hard to say who you'll be when they let those big red curtains close
You know this 'cause you told me so

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you forgot
Black heels in the summertime
Dad's bad, cookin' though, you'd be polite
Honey, now you got a look that I don't recognize
You pulled me aside and you said

[Chorus]
To know me is to hate me
Is to hate what I've become
It's to watch me as I'm fallin'
From that laddеr's last rung
It's to feel it like a secret
You can't keep in, I'm not thе way I was
I'm not the way I was

[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm-mm-mm, hmm-mm, mm

[Verse 2]
Were you freed within, did you leave your skin?
Are you tethered in your doubt?
Have you breathed it in 'til it's medicine that you cannot live without?
'Cause you came back home a fuckin' alien and we're stuck here on the ground
Call your mom back, kid, before the high comes down

Lord, hold me strong when old loss comes to meet me
Keep my fingers crossed, keep my knees weak

So when the world sees my face they'll never ask why

I'll tour the world and hope my anger dies behind me

And open up our blinds. Oh don't you know. Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind. Oh I, Catastrophize. Oh I, Catastrophize. Let me see the world through the kindness of my dad's eyes. Let every photograph be taken from my bad side. So when the world sees my face they'll never ask why. I look the way I do. . So let my soul be the only thing to guide me. I'll tour the world and hope my anger dies behind me. So if I fail I can blame it on bad timing. I'll love nothing that I can lose. . Oh my god. While we sit and wait for time. To change our luck. And open up our blinds. Oh don't you know. Don't you know that you're the last thing on my mind. Oh I, Catastrophize. Oh I, Catastrophize. . Oh my god. While we sit and wait for time.

36,Part of Me,"[Verse 1]
I think I forgot the things I've done
It's just good to be alive
And I could stay grateful for the sun
Though it's getting in my eyes
And how was Salt Lake City, dear?
Do you feel me?

'Cause now you let your heart get filled
With someone else's love
And now you've let your head get held
In someone else's arms
And if I die tomorrow, babe, would you feel me?
Feel me?

[Pre Chorus]
'Cause you were only a little bit of light
And you were only a minutе of my time
I don't miss you
I miss the way you made mе feel

[Chorus]
Like I lost part of me out there
My, my, my, my
When the space between our bodies disappeared
My, my, my, my
Even through the pain, I can't recall your face
Just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
I got so close to love with you, my dear
But I don't miss you
I miss the way you made me feel

37,Howling,"[Verse 1]
Where to begin?
Oh, let's pretend we never met
So I can disappear a moment
Been trying to swim with both my hands behind my back
My dear I always feared the ocean
And, somehow, this one word in my mouth that's left unspoken

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't admit my parents split when I got sick
But I refuse to be a burden
And I said

[Chorus]
Is there something keeping me here for the minute, darling?
Did you find the key and what is the meaning of it?
'Cause honey, sometimes I feel this emptiness
Howling out
Is there something keeping me here for the minute, darling?
Did I lose my mind and and am I still looking for it?
'Cause I don't know why I feel this emptiness
Howling out

[Verse 2]
""You’re not alone"" the world is small
And I am sick of all the talk of finding purpose
Love comes and goes
But the big black dog, he trails along
Am I the only one who knows him?
And now
And somehow, I gained 15 pounds, but lost my focus
And I suffocate things slow
Until I'm just the black fly circling my bullshit

I'm spinning in circles but I'm straight outta lines
With every excuse, I'm falling behind
Now watch me self destruct, right on time
I built up every wall I've had to climb

[Pre-Chorus]
When real life ain't nothing but anger and doubt
And failure's a stranger we all dream about

I hold it down, I hold it down
So, tell my doubts I'm comin' home
And put my failures on the phone
Hold it down, let it go

And now I'm filling a hole with falsehood and shame
Until my guilty skin will turn to stone
Lord, I'm a man of sin, now that I know

With every excuse, I'm falling behind
Now watch me self destruct, right on time
I built up every wall I've had to climb

[Pre-Chorus]
When real life ain't nothing but anger and doubt
And failure's a stranger we all dream about

[Chorus]
I hold it down, I hold it down
So, tell my doubts I'm comin' home
And put my failures on the phone
Hold it down, let it go
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I gambled my soul without knowing the stakes
And now I'm filling a hole with falsehood and shame
Until my guilty skin will turn to stone
Lord, I'm a man of sin, now that I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When real life ain't nothing but anger and doubt
And failure's a stranger we all dream about

[Chorus]
I hold it down, I hold it down
So, tell my doubts I'm comin' home
And put my failures on the phone

[Bridge]
'Cause real life ain't nothing but anger and doubt
And failure's a stranger we all've dreamed about
I hold it down
I'm looking for answers, but lost in my head
Now I reach into darkness and take what I get
I hold it down

39,Busyhead,"[Verse 1]
You're weak on the surface
You speak when you’re nervous
And all the wrong words seem right in your head
You can't stand the space in your bed
So you shake in the darkness
You break like an artist
And all your big plans are small the next day
You can't wait to throw them away

[Pre-Chorus]
You perseverate
And the truth might be a million miles away

[Chorus]
Hide your secrets, disguise your weakness
And lose yourself inside your busyhead
Burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
All alone inside your busyhead
Your busyhead

You sleep in the moment, but dream like a poet
And all your good grace, like faded tattoos
You spend your days in wait for bad news

Fast enough to tell a lie
Give yourself an alibi

Stand upon your peace of mind
You're bound to fall if you take your time

Find a home on the edge of it
And be defined by its presence
By its size and its message
You can move along through the dark
And when you wonder where you are
You'll be proud of your weakness
So, busyhead, just keep breathing, oh

40,If We Were Vampires,"[Verse 1: Noah Kahan]
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you've protected for so long
The mercy in your sense of right and wrong
It's not your hands searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth

[Chorus: Noah Kahan]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
It's likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But, one day, I'll be gonе
One day, you'll be gone

[Verse 2: Wesley Schultz]
If wе were vampires, and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
And laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

41,Fine,"[Verse 1]

I'm just a fish out in the sea
I'm just a preacher in the graveyard
Telling everyone but God to follow me

I'm just a liar who got lucky
I ain't no different from the rest
I might be jaded and delusional
But at least I found a home inside my head

This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the wild wild world that we live in
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive

I miss the honesty of pain
But I sever ties with all my anger

This is the wild wild world that we live in
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine

[Verse 3]
I miss the permanence of failure
I miss the honesty of pain
But I sever ties with all my anger
So I guess it's just the world we'll have to blame

[Pre-Chorus]
This is for all those dreams I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the wild wild world that we live in
I won't let anyone tell me I won't survive

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine
(I'll be just fine)

[Bridge]
Point your fingers like a gun
Ain't it sweet to be someone
Take your last breath to mend the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause this is for all those lies I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the last damn thing that I hold close to me
I won't let anyone so wrong tell me what's right

[Pre-Chorus]
And this is for all those dreams I believed in
This is for all those doubts in my mind
This is the wild wild world that we're, we living in
I won't let anyone so wrong tell me what's right

42,A Troubled Mind,"[Verse 1]
I told you, love, if you could see it through my eyes
You'd understand my fear of everything in sight
I know I'd quickly sell my heart for some advice
On how to ease a troubled mind
My brain's a dog asleep that I cannot let lie
Cloudy head, though I can't find a single silver lining
Guess there is no hope for me in sight
To ease this troubled mind

[Chorus]
I worry for the sun, yes, I worry for the snow
I worry I'll die young while I worry I'll grow old
Oh, I worry for the time I spent worrying alone
It makes me sad
It takes me back
I break in half
Ah-ooh, I break in half

[Verse 2]
I took a bus out to the city where you live
Eavesdropped on strangers' conversations with their kids
In hopes that maybe they'd say something relevant
To ease my worried head
Well, every mile that passed just amplified my fear
I started counting all the times I saw you last year
And suddenly it all became so clear
It was sadly making sense

[Verse 1: Noah Kahan]
Home alone again, I'm wonderin'
But you cut me off
Don't leave me alone with all my thoughts
I remember when, when you used to say
We could always talk
Even if all we had was lost

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Kahan]
Now you won't admit it
Burned the bridge and now you're leading me on
Come on
So save me the trouble
I don't want to suffer, move on
Move on

[Chorus: Noah Kahan]
Honey, you don't have to lie
That you're busy or too tired
You're out every weekend now
Takin' all your new friends out
It hurts my pride just a little
Yes, I die just a little
Oh no, you don't have to call
'Cause the photos say it all
I see you're letting your hair down
Takin' all your new friends out
It hurts my pride just a little
Yes, I die just a little every time

[Verse 2: mxmtoon]
You're not in my head, you're under my skin
And in my blood
I don't know why I care so much
I tried to understand what's in your plans
And what you want
'Cause you just keep me hanging on

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
Now you won't admit it
Burned the bridge and now you're leading me on
Come on
So save me the trouble
I don't want to suffer, move on
Move on

Honey, you don't have to lie (I don't have to lie)
That you're busy or too tired (I'm so tired)

Takin' all your new friends out

45,Come Down,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember the look on my face as I walked through the door?
You said your parents are gone from the States, we were here all alone
So we rolled up in the kitchen with the radio on
Playing Clapton as we put paper towels on the fire alarm

[Pre-Chorus]
And all at once, you started breaking down, down, down
Crying, saying, ""Please, don't leave me now""

[Chorus]
I know that you're so afraid
And it's getting late, but I'll stay 'til you come down
So close, but you're miles away
It'll be okay 'cause I'll stay 'til you come down

[Verse 2]
I watched, as the light left the room, I started talking you down
Just breathe for a moment or two, we can figure this out
But you said you needed silence, so I don't make a sound

[Pre-Chorus]
And all at once, you started breaking down, down, down
Crying, saying, ""Please, don't leave me now""

It's an empty shell I live in
The doors are always closed
And I spend my weeks
Losing my head, resting my bones
And they say that nothing's given
So I guess I'll get nothing at all
And I'll accept defeat
'Cause you can't swing
When the fight's lost
You know

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't see the grass getting greener 'cause
Out here ain't nothing but blue
And your eyes blood red, the high helps a little
But everyone you meet's just passing through
White lies take all of the color from you
Most nights you don't sleep at all
And you black out blind you hide
Is there any wonder no one ever really tries to call?

Ooh, I climb so high just to feel a fall and let it go

I think I found a fear of mine
That you might love for no reason
You know I worry
Only luck brought me to you
I'm half awake most of the time
It's just the timing of the seasons
So you know I worry

That all my fears are facts of life

48,Shape Of My Shadow,"[Verse 1]
There's somebody in my body
He's awake when I'm asleep
And he's making me feel ugly
And he's making me feel weak
I met him when I was younger
And he's lived with me since then
And we argue with each other
In the end, he always wins

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so terrified
That I'm forgetting which side I'm on
He tells nothing but lies
So, why do I believe every one?

[Chorus]
So, when you tell me, love
""You're gonna wear yourself thin""
Oh, don't I wish
""You must be healthy 'cause you don't look sick""
So, please stop asking why my clothes don't fit
'Cause I don't know, I don't know

49,Save Me,"[Verse 1]
I'm so passive, too sarcastic
Shut you out just out of habit
I don’t know
So I spent five months out here treading water
Now I wonder why you bothered
I don't know
Let me go

[Chorus]
Why do you keep reaching for my hand?
Do you see something I can't?
Why do you try to save me?
This fate is well deserved
I only make things worse
Why do you try to save me?

[Verse 2]
Have I served my sentence? Learned my lesson?
Healed those wounds from my indiscretions?
I don’t know
Am I still so selfish? Exile ended?
What do you see in my misdirections?
I don't know
Let me go

Oh, if I think too hard, I'm scared I might lose it

51,Fear of Water,"[Verse 1]
It's not what you think
These tears aren't some sweet response to tragedy
Today I can't say why they fall
Honey, it's all chemical
Don't be deceived
And don't take my bitterness as empathy
Darling, it's a broken bridge
Can you still get over it?

Give it a try

52,Tidal,"[Verse 1]
You knew me in my spiral
Happiness tidal, it comes and it goes
And I sank into the water
How I drifted farther away from the coast

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I get this feeling
I was breathing someone else's air
Two thousand miles away from home
Under that sky, I tried to make my peace with fear

[Chorus]
So I guess I'll build a boat and live alone
Lord, I'll be the lost one (Oh, oh)
Oh, I'll teach myself to swim and live in my head
And make sense of all my thoughts
And if I never reach the land or live again
Lord, I'll be just fine (Oh, oh)
Yeah, I'll drift until I'm dead, and until then
I'll be the lost one, I'll be the lost one

[Verse 2]
I fell into a pattern
Where nothing would matter if I didn't care
To be so close to a coastline
To know that in my life, I'd never be there

54,Someone Like You,"[Verse 1: Noah Kahan]
Guess I'm a mess now
Lost with my head down
I haven't heard from you in weeks
You must've left town
I can't go back now
And all that I have now
Are those feelings I felt
Knowing that no one else can bring them back out

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Kahan]
And I've been trying

55,Doors,"[Verse 1]
I grew up pretending sticks were little guns
I would point 'em at my dad, and he'd get mad
'Cause God forbid I'd hurt someone
I'd hurt anyone I could
Anyone who got too close, and anyone who wouldn't look

[Verse 2]
I was born into a one hundred-year storm
Foot of ice across Vermont
And in that dark, and in that frost, a heart was formed
Malcontented and unwarm
You were unprotected, not unwarned

[Chorus]
That I'm the trouble ahead, and I scream in my sleep
You put your money on red, I'm a sure bet at a losing streak
I keep showing you doors, but you can't opеn them up
It gets harder to see mе the closer you try to look

[Post-Chorus]
I just live here, babe, but you're the one who decided to knock
You knock

But now what?
I'm left staring at the ceiling, listing reasons you should pack all your shit up

58,Hollow,"[Verse 1]
I like to think I'm more than what my age is
With my fucked up sense of patience
And my deep self-deprecations
I, I try to cope with all the changes
When I smile on rare occasions
Can you see how old my face is?

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm getting old, I'm getting old, I'm getting old
Why are there so many things that I don't know, that I don't know?

[Chorus]
Wake up every day and put on my clothes
Hoping that 401k might fill up the hole in my soul
But I'm hollow
Yeah, I'm hollow
I'm scared to check the date
I'm scared of the dark
You can't escape it
No matter how fast the car
When you're hollow
And I'm hollow

[Verse 2]
I act like it's a choice that I'm still single
I'm smaller than the raindrops on the window
I'm colder than the backside of a pillow
And I've tried to hold my temper and obscure my rage
But these kids, they never act their age
And I've got one foot in the grave

59,Bury Me,"[Verse 1]
I never found a heart I couldn't break
For you I hoped my parts would rearrange
You'd see a change
Do you see a change
Oh, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause honey now this house feels like a grave
And now I cannot help but take the blame
For every stain
For messes I've made with your heart

They're up, ready, they've been six feet underneath
Can't you see?

[Chorus]
So our times come around
And our wounds run deep
There ain't no words to speak
Honey, bury me
Watch it fall
Let it drown
In a deep blue sea
Baby, bury me

60,Best Friend*,"[Verse 1]
I know that you need a best friend
Someone to settle your soul
Someone to see and to be like
To try to fit into your clothes
I know this winter feels colder
I know the days move so slow
We're both just on opposite pages
Of a book with an ending we wrote

[Chorus]
I'll be back
Don't you know I'll be right back?
Heart intact, head in lap
I'll still be your best friend

[Verse 2]
I never bothered to tell you
I always assumed that you knew
I'd trade every milе I've walked
To be within two feet of you

[Chorus]
But I'll bе back
Don't you know I'll be right back?
Heart intact, head in lap
I'll still be your best friend, oh

62,Spoiled,"[Verse 1]
Gambling with the sun
On which one of us dies young
I ain't afraid to hold the gun
If it leads to me the safe
Tell the fellas at the morgue
That I'm heading back on tour
Gonna put them boys to work
""Wipe your hands and wash your face""

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm filling every pause
I'm speaking when I know something
It's everything I want
It's everything I want

[Chorus]
I hope my children get spoiled when they get old
So they can fuck up all they want and blame it all on their dad
So they can watch me go to work then fall asleep on the couch
They'll say, ""I wanna be you, but I don't wanna be that""
They'll say, ""I wanna be you, but I don't wanna be that""

[Verse 2]
I'm betting on the north
To drag my ass back down to Earth
'Cause, where I'm from and what I'm worth
Have gotten too damn intertwined
If I'm gone this time next year
If I inhale the smoke and smash the mirrors
Fuck it, I might even disappear
I hope you've had a decent time

And you sang about a place I've known my whole life
And you sang in such a sad and angry way

When I drove you home from every restaurant?
Where they drank and ate, but mostly they ignored ya
But I bit my cheeks, and I screamed for every song

You were so quiet
I wanted so bad
To feel you
To be near you
But you were so mad

I'm always on my own

[Post-Chorus]
I'm always on my own
One, two, three, four

[Verse 5]
I ain't planned it, the plane, the plane just landed out here
Rubbed my eyes on 89, double yellow, murdered deer
You can't vanish, yes, love, you can try to disappear
A thousand miles on a dirt road, strike a light, let it burn slow

[Verse 6]
Maybe I'm manic again, but I think, this time, I'm out for good
I'm a sidewalk preacher with a record deal, I'm the [weight of?] new sneakers off the network
This ain't mine anymore, I made too much goddamn noise
From staring at the void [instead of casting?] with the boys

[Chorus]
Know I wanna beat it, wanna beat it bad
Oh, everyone looks happy in a photograph
I've crossed the county line, I cannot go back
I'm always on my own
Couldn't make it home 'cause of all that rain
Oh, run of bad luck in a nowhere state
I'm high above us now in a big jet plane
I'm always on my own

[Post-Chorus]
I'm always on my own

[Bridge]
See the dried flood lines on the neighbor's porches
Do you remember crying for all them horses?
They did not look scared at all
They did not look scared, they did not look scared at all

[Chorus]
Know I wanna beat it, wanna beat it bad
Oh, everyone looks happy in a photograph
I've crossed the county line that I cannot go back
I'm always on my own

68,If It Helps You,"[Verse 1]
Storm took the phone lines down
And now your ride can't call
And you're bouncing off the walls
I stretched my arms real wide
Tried to break your fall
But you got up, mad as hell and told me that I had it all

[Verse 2]
I tried to heal your wounds
Just to say I helped
Just to say that some small fame ain't made me someone else
It ain't a high road now
Just uneven ground
And I ain't even around to slow your speed down

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me, ""If a lie turned true
A lie it would still be
You ain't a goddamn hero now 'cause you cry on live TV""

[Chorus]
But at least I got a soul still
Evеn if I'm in a bad place
Even if I'm eating fast food
Sleeping at my dad's placе
I'm happy for your haircut
I'm glad you got your act cleaned
You're showing up like bad news
And leaving like a bad dream
Help me if it helps you sleep
Help me if it helps you write
Help me if it helps you leave
Help me if it helps you lie

I don't need your [cosign?] now
Oh, we get along just fine
One hundred years, laying [?] in the dirt
[Soil over?] the copper mines
You grew your hair out long
Don't think you're Jesus Christ
No one's mistaking your guilt for some [small sacrifice?]

[Verse 4]
You've got New Hampshire's face
Left us for the New York Times
Now you shuffle around like a ghost
Asking people how you die

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, if a lie turned true
A lie it would still be
You ain't a goddamn hero now 'cause you cry on live TV

[Chorus]
But at least I got a soul still
Even if I'm in a bad place
Even if I'm eating fast food
Sleeping at my dad's place
I'm happy for your haircut
I'm glad you got your act cleaned
You're showing up like bad news
And leaving like a bad dream
Help me if it helps you sleep
Help me if it helps you write
Help me if it helps you leave
Help me if it helps you lie
[Bridge]
We were fine without you, baby
Drove your ass home
You walked into a haunted house
And got angry at the ghosts
[And we would smile?] at you, baby
Long after you're gone
Spare us all the pity, babe
Save it for your microphone

[Instrumental Break]

But at least I got a soul still

Help me if it helps you leave, oh

[Verse 1]
Storm took the phone lines down
And now your ride can't call
And you're bouncing off the walls
I stretched my arms real wide
Tried to break your fall
But you got up, mad as hell and told me that I had it all

[Verse 2]
I tried to heal your wounds
Just to say I helped
Just to say that some small fame ain't made me someone else
It ain't a high road now
Just uneven ground
And I ain't even around to slow your speed down

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me, ""If a lie turned true
A lie it would still be
You ain't a goddamn hero now 'cause you cry on live TV""

Honey, come over
The party's gone slower
And no one will tempt you
We know you got sober
There's orange juice in the kitchen
Bought for the children
It's yours if you want it
We're just glad you could visit

Feels like I've been ready for you to come home

""You are not who I thought""
I said, ""I rarely am, unless you always thought that I was just a fool""
If I wrote a book of songs worth keeping
It'd be short and full of plot holes and foreshadowings of doom

[Pre-Chorus]
I woke up inside a nightmare
Parading as my wildest dreams
And I snorted Ambien
I'm a deer in three and four quarter inch bike headlights
When they hit my eyes, I feel like a fucking alien

[Chorus]
I am bored of all my bullshit
Nothing's yours if you can't hold it
Astronauts don't like the feeling when they land
Is my heart still in your stomach?
Are you cured of my emotions?
I am overweight, and, God, I miss my band
I miss my band

Called my mom, and found the only
Things worth fighting are the things you want the most out of your head

I said, ""I rarely am, unless you always thought that I was just a fool""
If I wrote a book of songs worth keeping
It'd be short and full of plot holes and foreshadowings of doom

[Pre-Chorus]
I woke up inside a nightmare
Parading as my wildest dreams
And I snorted Ambien
I'm a deer in three and four quarter inch bike headlights
When they hit my eyes, I feel like a fucking alien

[Chorus]
I am bored of all my bullshit
Nothing's yours if you can't hold it
Astronauts don't like the feeling when they land
Is my heart still in your stomach?
Are you cured of my emotions?
I am overweight, and, God, I miss my band
I miss my band

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Burnt my lungs on the ash of every song I started writing
But got bored and smoked instead
Called my mom, and found the only
Things worth fighting are the things you want the most out of your head

[Chorus]
I am bored of all my bullshit
Nothing's yours if you can't hold it
Astronauts don't like the feeling when they land
Are you cured of my emotion?
Is my heart still in your stomach?
I am overweight, and, God, I miss my band

77,Men’s Room*,"[Verse 1]
I'm waiting for God in the men's room
Feeling more and more like a metaphor
For everything wrong with the men's room
Any mess I make, I do not say sorry for

[Verse 2]
[I threw my face through?] the lens of a camera
I say, ""Look at you, who the hell are you?""
And, deep in my head, there's an answer
But it's raining out, I got shit to do

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, I'm drinking again
I'm kicking a can on down the road just to see where it lands
Oh-oh, oh-oh, to spinning my wheels
'Cause all of the secrets I can't keep sit outside of the hills
So, I'll die on this hill

[Verse 3]
I'm floating around like a phantom
Like a stray dog, like I was laid off
And hope that I found is a cancer
Hope my bitterness finally paid off

""Your turn"", you said, ""We ain't finished yet
I've got another half hour, and the nurse just left
And I stole a Marb Red from that surgeon's desk
With the wife and two kids and a seven-year itch""

[Verse 2]
So, I said, ""Sharks, I guess, or being burnt alive""
And you said, ""There are far, far worse ways to die""
And I looked like a child as I started to cry
And you looked like a bride in your hospital whites

[Chorus]
We're supposed to be kids, I love you, and fuck this
Let's get drunk in room 10 under the halide lamps
And we'll close our eyes, and the ceiling will spin
And we'll wake close to the river where the college kids swim
And we know it won't last while we float on our backs
But we'll stay in the water 'til the nurses get mad
They'll say, ""What the fuck are you doing? You know it's worse if she drinks
Don't you dare wake her up, she's got somewhere to be""

You say “That’s fine, 'cause you’re working on yourself and that counts”
And I haven’t done a lot of things right
You say “Good, way to rule all the bad things out”

You said I don’t know how beautiful I am
You say you got front row seats to me and you promise it’s flawless from beginning to end

80,Porch Light,"[Verse 1]
I would ask you how you've been, it's all over the internet
Oh, yeah, I mean we knew that after all
If you're looking for an autopsy or a half-assed half-apology
Then I think you picked the wrong time to make this call

[Verse 2]
It is not irrelevant that you stopped taking your medicine
But I'm giving you the benefit 'cause it's raining now
I'll tell you how the weather is, and I'll slip into some eloquently
Rambling mixed-messaging, I should shut you down

But you don't, and it's cold, and it's cold, and it's cold
And I don't know, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alonе, I'm alone

I hope you tell mе that you're winding down, that you lost the taste to face the crowd
That whatever made you famous made you sick
But you can only do what pain allows, it ain't up to you to make it out
And there ain't no shame in calling this thing quits

So it goes, so it goes, so it goes

You act like we just sit up here and wait for you to reappear
But, baby, there are bills to pay and your dad's road needs salt
And I try to drown out all the talk, the eyeballs in the parking lots

The run on sentences, the overuse of ampersands
I'm living here now, and it ain't bad but it ain't Amsterdam

So I can call foul when I fuck up and nothing happens next
Signing my name for fans but always leave an asterisk
'Cause I'm a smoking, bad, free-throwing pro who has the yips

I want boredom, I hate autumn, I got means, now I want ends
I want the last minutes of morning when I am not angry yet
I want youth, I wanna to puke out all the bullshit in my mouth
I want to see me as you see me and not how I see mysеlf
I'm okay with burning out, I'm okay with falling off

Look at that, a beautiful spectrum
(What the fuck is—, alright, here we go)

[Verse 1: Noah Kahan]
Oh, I think I've found a way to keep myself whole
I write my fears on green notes
I swallow my doubts away and watch them grow old
Is that why the past years seemed slow?

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Kahan]
Take me my heart and my soul
Pick me apart and look inside, inside
Fill me with dreams I can't hold
Keep me afloat in this cold world, cold world

85,Pain Eater*,"[Verse 1]
Thought I had some true magic forming
From real far back, I looked truly important
Stood and laughed at myself in the mirror
Drove my car ninety-five on Omira
I told my dad to stop sending me letters
From broken folks with their feet on the embers
'Cause, ""I don’t know"", doesn't feel like an answer
And, ""Glad I helped"", is not curing your cancer

[Verse 2]
I woke up in a townhouse in Nashville
Bought myself like one hundred pairs of shoes
Close enough to a childhood nightmare
And I wish I'd die
Or at least wish I'd lose
Ain't it strange all my heroes are anxious?
Ain't it odd how I ask you to cheer?
Pour one out for the rich, sad, and famous
Cry for me and I'll tour there next year

[Chorus]
Turn back, turn back

I'll heal your heart of everything that's lost
And hope to God our memories don't fade
Whenever you feel our years might be forgotten
Whenever the tears are running in your face

[Chorus]
Hold my arm, and I'll fall into you
And we can both retreat when we're bursting at the seams

The shadows of our dreams
When we're bursting at the seams

Every mile apart will feel like inches
And every hour passed, and second time
We will hold the weight of all the distance
When we can go to the same place in our minds

Oh, everybody knows you're dyin'
Everybody knows
Oh, everybody knows
Everybody knows you're dyin'

[Verse 1]
You're selling all the shit inside your house
I guess you decide what you can live without
But the emptiness around
Leaves very little doubt
Everyone can see you're dyin'

[Verse 2]
You're telling us that you're making some plans
And hopin' that we all misunderstand
You're smart enough to know the difference
Between a dream and a decision
Everyone can see you're dyin'
Everyone can see you're dyin'

[Verse 3]
""Your turn,"" she said, ""We ain't finished yet""
We got another half hour and the nurse just left
And I stole more bread from that surgeon's desk
With a wife and two kids and a seven-year itch
I said, ""Shucks, I guess they're bein' burned alive""
You told me there are far worse ways to die
You looked like a bride in your hospital whites
And I looked like a child as I started to cry

We're supposed to be kids, forgive and fuck this
Let's get drunk in Room 10 under the halo lamps
And we'll close our eyes and the room starts to spin
We wade close to the river where the college kids swim
And we know it won't last, but we float on our backs
But we'll stay in the water 'til the nurses get mad
They'll say, ""What the hell are you doin'? You know it's worse if she drinks""
Don't dare wake us up, we've got somewhere to be
But everybody knows you're dyin'

You always told me to spend more time dancing in the rain. Finding lessons in the pain. Living life like it's a stage. You were my freedom. I'm the artist and the architect of all that I've became.
